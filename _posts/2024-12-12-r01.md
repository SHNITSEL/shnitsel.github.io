description: "Fulvene (<b>R01</b>) is a six-membered ring system known for its ultrafast excited-state deactivation. After photoexcitation, the molecule rapidly decays through a conical intersection that involves planarization of the methylene group. Its well-defined excited-state dynamics make it a common benchmark for theoretical studies."
