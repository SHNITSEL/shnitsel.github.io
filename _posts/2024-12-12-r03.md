description: "Tyrosine (<b>R03</b>) is an amino acid with a phenol side chain that exhibits complex photochemical behavior. It was the first biological molecule in which hydrogen atom roaming—a phenomenon where an excited-state hydrogen migrates before dissociation—was observed. Understanding its excited-state properties is crucial for studying photochemical processes in biomolecules."
