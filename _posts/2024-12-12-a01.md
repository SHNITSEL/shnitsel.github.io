description: 'Ethene (<b>A01</b>) is one of the simplest organic molecules and serves as a fundamental benchmark for excited-state dynamics. 
Upon photoexcitation, it undergoes a torsional motion around the double bond, leading to a well-defined conical intersection at a 90Â° torsion angle. 
This makes ethene a widely used system for testing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and surface hopping methods.
