description: "2-Butene (<b>A03</b>) is a key model system for <i>E/Z</i>-isomerization, a fundamental photochemical process in which a molecule undergoes double-bond rotation upon excitation. 
Its ability to switch between <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i>-configurations makes it an important case for studying excited-state reaction pathways."
