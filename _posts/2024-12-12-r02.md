description: "1,3-Cyclohexadiene (<b>R02</b>) undergoes a photochemical electrocyclic ring-opening reaction upon excitation, forming an open-chain structure. 
This process is an important example of pericyclic photochemistry and serves as a model for studying light-induced structural rearrangements."
