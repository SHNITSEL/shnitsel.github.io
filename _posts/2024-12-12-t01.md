description: "Methanethione (<b>T01</b>) is a sulfur-containing molecule that exhibits slow singlet-to-triplet intersystem crossing. 
This process, where the molecule transitions between different spin states, provides valuable insights into nonradiative relaxation and spin-orbit coupling effects."
