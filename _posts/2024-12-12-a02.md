description: "Propene (<b>A02</b>) is a small alkene that extends the ethene (<b>A01</b>) system by introducing a methyl group, which influences both steric and electronic properties. 
Like <b>A01</b>, it undergoes torsional motion in the excited state, providing a slightly more complex test case for nonadiabatic dynamics."
