.. py:function:: plot_time_interstate_error(data, state_selection, ax)

   Function to plot the error bars/confidence intervals on time series interstate plots.

   Uses the `upper`, `lower` and `mean` variables of `data`.

   :param data:     Interstate Dataset containing the `upper`, `lower` and `mean` variables generated by a confidence interval calculation.
                Data must have the appropriate unit as conversion is not possible without knowing the target dimension or unit.
                You can set the units in the `unit` attribute of the data.
                Similarly, you can specify the y-axis label with the `tex` attribute of the data.
                The time will, however, be converted to fs if not yet converted.
   :type data: Dataset
   :param state_selection: State selection object to limit the states included in plotting and to provide state names.
   :type state_selection: StateSelection
   :param ax: Axes object to plot the graph to.
   :type ax: Axes

   :returns: The axes that have been plotted to
   :rtype: Axes


.. py:function:: plot_populations_graph(pops, state_selection, ax)

   Plot a graph of populations to the provided axes.

   :param pops: The per-state population data. We expect the `time` data to be in fs. If it can be converted, it will be converted to fs.
   :type pops: PopulationStatistics
   :param state_selection: State selection object to limit the states included in plotting and to provide state names.
   :type state_selection: StateSelection
   :param ax: The Axes object to plot the population graph into
   :type ax: Axes

   :returns: The resulting Axes object after the plot
   :rtype: Axes


.. py:function:: plot_timeplots(pops, delta_E, fig, state_selection, fosc_time = None, axs = None)

   Function to generate all time plots, involving population plots and state-transition plots.

   :param pops: object containing state population data with a time coordinate
   :type pops: PopulationStatistics
   :param delta_E: Dataset containing the energy delta per state combination.
   :type delta_E: xr.Dataset
   :param fig: A figure, consumed by the autmatic axes generation. Not used by the function itself.
   :type fig: Figure| SubFigure
   :param state_selection: State selection object to limit the states included in plotting and to provide state names.
   :type state_selection: StateSelection
   :param fosc_time: The oscillation frequency in a DataArray groupable by `time`
   :type fosc_time: xr.DataArray, optional
   :param axs: The dictionary of named Axes objects to plot the inidividual graphs into. Defaults to None.
   :type axs: dict[str, Axes], optional

   :returns: The axes dictionary after plotting.
   :rtype: dict[str, Axes]
