        Thank you for your interest in contributing to SHNITSEL by submitting a database. 
        To streamline the process and ensure the security of your data, we kindly request that you follow these guidelines:
        <li> <b>Link Submission:</b> Instead of uploading your database directly through this form, please provide us with a link where we can access the database. 
          This can be a URL pointing to a cloud storage platform or a file-sharing service.</li>
        
        <li> <b>File Format:</b> The database should be packaged in a ASE (Atomic Simulation Environemnt) format. 
          If your database consists of multiple files, please compress them into a single archive (e.g., ZIP or RAR) before sharing the link.</li>

        <li> <b>Description and Attribution:</b> Along with the link, please provide a brief description of the database, including its purpose, source, and any relevant details. 
          If applicable, include any specific attribution requirements or licenses associated with the database.</li>

        <li> <b>Contact Information:</b> Finally, provide your contact information (name and email) in the form below so that we can reach out to you if we have any questions or require additional information about the database.</li>

        By submitting your database, you acknowledge that you have the necessary rights and permissions to share the data and grant us the right to publish it on our website.
        Thank you for contributing and helping us to grow the SHNITSEL collection. 
        We appreciate your support!
